mIRC Scripts
============
The mIRC/MSL scripts here are scripts I've created. Some scripts may use bits of code provided by others and I'll try and provide credit where it's needed.

# Remotes
These scripts for things what can react to IRC events (such as someone joining a channel, saying something, etc). To access mIRC's remote scripting press ALT+R or Tool > Scripts Editor. The window will open in the remotes section (as noted by the "Remote" tab at the very top of the page).

# Aliases
foobar

# Colours

## An important note on colours

If you've used colours in mIRC before, you'll know that the symbol for colours can be described as an elevated L, and the symbol for bold is the same symbol rotated 180 degree.

Sadly, github doesn't display these symbols, even if the file format is .mrc. Even using markdown the symbol isn't shown as shown below.

    /msg #Example 4Foo 12bar 3foobar.
    
So, in order to get around this issue, if you see "[]" with a letter inside, this is to tell you that one of those unseen symbols is in use and you need to replace that symbol in mIRC in order for things to work corre
